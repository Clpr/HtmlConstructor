# HtmlConstructor

This project provides a work flow, types & functions to generate HTML tags and pages. It was originally developed to save my time in writing an online form page, but I find there are much more things that this project can do. So I refactor it for more general programming purposes. Users may find it is easy to use this project to generate their own (simple) HTML pages. To learn the work flow, please read the demo in `test.jl`.

By the way, I have not make this project a registered package. I will do so if everything goes well in the future. And, this project is expected to serve simple HTML development. Advanced usage, e.g. `php` with HTML is not considered (at least in this project).
